# Lightweight-Java-GitHub-Loader
A lightweight application for when you need to download a file from GitHub but are too lazy to do it the right way.

Notes: The application should only need the latest Java 8 JRE to work correctly. It has not been tested on OSX or Linux so it may not work on those systems.
